# Unity-MachineLearning
A collection of the projects I am working on in Unity focused around teaching myself machine learning.

I broke it up through branching for each game to simplify downloading individual examples.

Projects contained within:
  All Projects with MLLearning tag:
    - These are projects that are the result of me following along with a paid Machine Learning course focused in Unity.
    - I have embellished some of them when I found it more interesting and wanted to see how far I could go, or to see what else I could learn from it.
    
  Other Projects:
    - RogueLike ML Game is a game based around the question: "what sort of game type would have enough enemies dying that it would actually benefit when using a
      Genetic Algorithm to learn how to fight the player, but still be worth not needing to just write a simple 'AI go here' script?"
        - The result is a Rogue-like where the enemies are based off of a GA, combined with the idea of eventually having the actual dungeon itself be generated
          by a Neural Network that is focused on making the player's life as hard as possible.
        - The idea is that the game would start relatively easy with dumb enemies running into walls and such, and ideally as the player was getting better at
          playing the game, the enemies would get harder to kill and better at shooting the player.
